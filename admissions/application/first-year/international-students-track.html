        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p>A prospective student must either hold or be expected to hold a high school diploma or a certificate of high school equivalency (e.g. GED) before matriculating at UIC.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the student must be a non-Korean with non-Korean parents. If the student or any one of the student’s parents has dual citizenship with Korea, the student is NOT eligible for the International Students Track. Exception: A Taiwanese applicant with one parent of Taiwanese citizenship is classified as an international student for application purposes.</p>
        <p>※ Unless the student submits 1) his/her AND 2) parent's Korean nationality renunciation paper by application deadline, we are sorry to say that the student’s application cannot be accepted.</p>
        <p>※ The application paper to the Embassy (접수증) is NOT accepted, but the official paper issued by Korean government saying that the process is completely finished is ONLY valid.</p>
        <p>The standard for judging the nationality of the student and the student’s parents will be based on passports. Foreigners with Korean ethnicity must submit legal documentation that verifies their renunciation of Korean citizenship.</p>
